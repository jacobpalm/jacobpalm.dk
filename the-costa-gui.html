title: 'The Costa GUI'
---

<p>A hobby coding project of mine, Costa is a program which runs on top of MS-DOS or compatible operating systems. The aim is to replace the DOS-prompt with a clean, user-friendly interface – a so called GUI (Graphical User Interface). Costa comes with full mouse and keyboard support, and a bunch of useful accessories.</p>

<p>Most development took place between 2004 and 2012, when version 1.0 was released. Since then I have moved on to other projects, and now rarely fire up the code editor to work on Costa.</p>

<p><a href="https://costa.jacobpalm.dk">Costa has it’s own homepage</a>, where you can learn more and download the program free of charge.</p>
