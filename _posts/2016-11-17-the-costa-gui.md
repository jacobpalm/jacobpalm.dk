A hobby coding project of mine, Costa is a program which runs on top of MS-DOS or compatible operating systems. The aim of it is to replace the DOS-prompt with a clean, user-friendly interface â€“ a so called GUI (Graphical User Interface). Costa comes with full mouse and keyboard support, and a bunch of useful accessories.

Most development took place between 2004 and 2012, when version 1.0 was released. Since then I have moved on to other projects, and now rarely fire up the code editor to work on Costa.
