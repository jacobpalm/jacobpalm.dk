# JacobPalm.dk

This repository simply hosts the content for my personal website, <https://jacobpalm.dk>.

Site rendered using Github Pages and Jekyll, using a simple CSS grid based template created by myself. Originally I used the "flexible-jekyll" theme by arthemsheludke, which is why this repository is shown as forked from that repository.
