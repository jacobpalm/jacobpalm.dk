I usually advocate free (and preferably open-source) software only, but I have come across a Windows application that merits an exception to this rule.

Over the years, I have used many different software solutions for note-taking, and to keep track of my tasks in various projects. Microsoft OneNote, Evernote, plain text files &#8211; and countless others.

While software like OneNote and Evernote have many great features, I often find them far to cumbersome and bloated for my purposes. For that reason, I have always reverted back to my old ways and used plain text files. These are small in size, and can be opened everywhere &#8211; at the sacrifice of any real functionality and formatting.

So, I went another way and used Markdown. This allowed me to take my notes in plain text files, and to have them rendered beautifully on the screen. But, there&#8217;s a drawback to this as well: Although Markdown is plain text, it is not pretty to look at &#8220;raw&#8221; when opening on a device or in an editor without Markdown formatting. And there&#8217;s usually no functionality to handle tasks and the like.

Some time ago I stumbled across the perfect software for my needs &#8211; JNote.<span style="font-size: inherit;">JNote is extremely light-weight, but still manages to cram in countless features for note taking and task management. You can insert headings of various sizes, lists, tables, and more &#8211; all in plain text, looking terrific in any editor. But the real magic happens when these files are displayed in JNote itself &#8211; because then, everything is formatted and highlighted beautifully on the screen. JNote will even build a tree-view menu &#8211; a table of contents, if you will &#8211; linking to any heading in the document.</span>

Take a look at the screenshot below, and see how the same file looks great in Notepad, but really comes to life in JNote:

<div class="wp-block-image">

</div>

On top of this, JNote has an extensive task-management functionality baked in. You can insert tasks, and mark them with progress, responsible person, comments, and status &#8211; all in plain text. You can then get a graphical list view of all tasks in a document. You can also set reminders on tasks, or anywhere in a document really, and JNote will show a notification when that time comes. It&#8217;s also possible to link to other text files, and then use an ingenious nested crawl-search to get a list of any occurrence of a search term, in any linked file.

</div>

Be it project management, simple to-do lists, documentation or note-taking &#8211; JNote has become an integral part of everything I work on. Simple, light-weight and full of useful features. Highly recommended!
