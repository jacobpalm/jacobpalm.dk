A long time hobby coding project of mine. Costa is a program which runs on top of MS-DOS or compatible operating systems, which replaces the DOS-prompt with a clean, user-friendly interface - a so called GUI (Graphical User Interface). Costa comes with full mouse and keyboard support, and a bunch of useful accessories.
