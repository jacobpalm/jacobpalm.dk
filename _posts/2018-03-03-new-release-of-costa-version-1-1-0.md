Yesterday I released a new version of my long-time hobby coding project, the MS-DOS based graphical shell Costa.

There's not much new to see. I added a "Tip of the Day" dialog, and some new icons for you to choose from when creating desktop links, but mostly it's all about bugfixes and improved stability.

Head on over to <https://costa.jacobpalm.dk> to grab a copy free of charge. The changelog for version 1.1.0 can be found in the Archive.

For those who are interested in development, [visit GitHub](https://github.com/jacobpalm/costa) to have a look at the source code. It's not the most fancy codebase as it has been coded on-and-off over the past decade, but it's stable and fairly compact.
