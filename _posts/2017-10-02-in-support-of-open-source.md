Over the past couple of years I have been using Open Source software increasingly. More and more of the applications I use everyday have been replaced by open source alternatives, and I now only have a handful of proprietary software left. Even my operating system has been replaced by Ubuntu Gnome.

Since I am using so much open source software, I figured I would live up to this ideal by releasing the source code to one of my own pieces of software, <a href="http://costa.jacobpalm.dk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Costa GUI</a>.

<!--more-->

As of September 2017, the full source code is available on Github:  
<https://github.com/jacobpalm/costa>

This also fulfills a long overdue promise I made several years ago on my old GUI related website, where I declared that the code would be available once version 1.0 was released.
