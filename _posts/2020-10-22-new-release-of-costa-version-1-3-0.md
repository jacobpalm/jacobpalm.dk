After a 2&frac12; year hiatus, I have once again pulled the source code for my DOS based GUI, **Costa**, out of storage, and added some new features. This time around, I've implemented some bug fixes, and a whole new theme editor.

With this new theme editor, users can now customize any color of the interface - either by modifying existing themes, or making their own. User submissions are welcome!
