Yesterday I released a new version of my long-time hobby coding project, the MS-DOS based graphical shell **Costa**.

There&#8217;s not much new to see. I added a &#8220;Tip of the Day&#8221; dialog, and some new icons for you to choose from when creating desktop links, but mostly it&#8217;s all about bugfixes and improved stability.

Head on over to [http://costa.jacobpalm.dk](http://costa.jacobpalm.dk/) to grab a copy free of charge. The changelog for version 1.1.0 can be found in the Archive.

For those who are interested in development, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/jacobpalm/costa" target="_blank">visit GitHub</a> to have a look at the source code. It&#8217;s not the most fancy codebase, as it has been coded on-and-off over the past decade, but it&#8217;s stable and fairly compact.
